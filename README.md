# 🤖 Appium Parallel Execution – Android & iOS (Native + Web)

This project demonstrates parallel test execution across **Android native apps**, **iOS native apps**, and **Android mobile web apps** — all from a single Appium server instance.

By leveraging **multiple Appium sessions** with different capabilities, we execute tests on different platforms and OS versions simultaneously.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Parallel execution on Android and iOS devices/emulators
- 🌐 Supports both native apps and mobile browser testing
- 🔁 Single Appium server instance handles multiple sessions
- ⚙️ Platform-specific capabilities using TestNG or JUnit
- 🔍 Logs for each session to track device-wise execution

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Java**
- **Appium**
- **TestNG** 
- **Android Studio / Xcode**
- **Mobile Emulators / Real Devices**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Start a single Appium server instance.
2. Define device-specific desired capabilities in your test framework.
3. Launch parallel sessions using TestNG XML.
4. Each session targets a different device (Android/iOS), app type (native/web), and OS version.
5. View results per platform/device.
